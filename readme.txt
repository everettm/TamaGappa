Readme.txt

1. TamaGappa is at it's core a caretaking app. You start the game with your very own Appa that you must love and care for. You can feed him, tickle him, play with him, make him sleep, and clean up after him. But be careful! Be sure to keep track of the stats page, to make sure that your friend doesn't get too hungry, sad, sick, or tired. Feed him to make him less hungry, make him sleep to give him more energy, play one of our four mini games to level him up, and MORE! The better you get at games, and the more you beat however, the faster Appas stats will decrease, making the game harder over time.

2. Overall the game is fairly robust. There are a few issues that we weren't able to work out, however.
- If you lose a level in elimination game and choose not to continue, it won't restart the level when reloading the game. If you choose to continue, however, it will restart nicely.
